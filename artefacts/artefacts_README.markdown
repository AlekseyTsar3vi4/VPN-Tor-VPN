# Artefacts Directory

This directory contains sample configuration files and checksums used in the VPN-Tor-VPN project for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Disclaimer
The `.ovpn` files (e.g., `clienttest.ovpn`, `exittovpn.ovpn`) are provided **for educational purposes only**. These are sample OpenVPN configurations used during the project's testing phase and **cannot be used to connect to an active VPN-Tor-VPN chain**. They lack valid server endpoints and credentials. To create a functional setup, follow the deployment instructions in the main [README.md](../README.md).
